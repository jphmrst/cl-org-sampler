* Use Org-mode in your Common Lisp docstrings
If you write your Common Lisp documentation strings in Org-mode
format, you can use this package to extract each symbol use into its
own separate Org file.  Then your user manual and other documentation
can just include these sampled extracts to more easily keep your
documentation synchronized with the source code.
