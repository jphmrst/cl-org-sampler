* Use Org-mode in your Common Lisp docstrings
To more easily keep your documentation synchronized with the source
code, write your Common Lisp documentation strings in Org-mode format
and use this system to extract each symbol usage into its own separate
Org file. Then your user manual and other documentation can just
include these sampled extracts.  Updates to the manual can then be
automated from updates to the docstrings - which we're more likely to
actually remember to do.
